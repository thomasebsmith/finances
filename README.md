This project provides a Python library that you can use for finances. It is
designed for dealing with United States financial law. It includes tax
estimation functionality and will be extended to include financial simulation
functionality in the future.

## Prerequisites
You will need:
- Python >= 3.8

## Quick Start
It is recommended to install and run this library in a virtual environment.
However, doing so is not required.

To run an example program that uses this library:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/thomasebsmith/finances.git
$ cd finances
$ python3 -m src.finances.__main__
```

To run this library's unit tests (this will automatically create a virtual
environment and install test dependencies in it):
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/thomasebsmith/finances.git
$ cd finances
$ ./scripts/test.sh
```
